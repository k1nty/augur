BRUINS GITHUB AUGUR REPO SUBMISSION TOOL / SPRINT 4

This project’s goal is to give users a frontend platform to easily submit GitHub repos to be assessed by Augur. User’s will need to login to the frontend application with a username and password. Users can then submit a GitHub repo to be assessed by Augur

For installation / running instructions see sprint 3 readme for frontend and see augur docs for backend

What is Augur?

Augur is a software suite for collecting and measuring structured data about free and open-source software (FOSS) communities.

We gather trace data for a group of repositories, normalize it into our data model, and provide a variety of metrics about said data. The structure of our data model enables us to synthesize data across various platforms to provide meaningful context for meaningful questions about the way these communities evolve.

We are a CHAOSS project, and many of our metrics are implementations of the metrics defined by our awesome community. You can find more information about how to get involved on the CHAOSS website.
Collecting Data

One of Augur's core tenets is a desire to openly gather data that people can trust, and then provide useful and well-defined metrics that help give important context to the larger stories being told by that data. We do this in a variety of ways, one of which is doing all our own data collection in house. We currently collect data from a few main sources:

    Raw Git commit logs (commits, contributors)
    GitHub's API (issues, pull requests, contributors, releases, repository metadata)
    The Linux Foundation's Core Infrastructure Initiative API (repository metadata)
    Succinct Code Counter, a blazingly fast Sloc, Cloc, and Code tool that also performs COCOMO calculations

This data is collected by dedicated data collection workers controlled by Augur, each of which is responsible for querying some subset of these data sources. We are also hard at work building workers for new data sources. If you have an idea for a new one, please tell us - we'd love your input!
Getting Started

If you're interested in collecting data with our tool, the Augur team has worked hard to develop a detailed guide to get started with our project which can be found in our documentation.

If you're looking to contribute to Augur's code, you can find installation instructions, development guides, architecture references (coming soon), best practices and more in our developer documentation. Please know that while it's still rather sparse right now, but we are actively adding to it all the time. If you get stuck, please feel free to ask for help!
Contributing

To contribute to Augur, please follow the guidelines found in our CONTRIBUTING.md and our Code of Conduct. Augur is a welcoming community that is open to all, regardless if you're working on your 1000th contribution to open source or your 1st. We strongly believe that much of what makes open source so great is the incredible communities it brings together, so we invite you to join us!
